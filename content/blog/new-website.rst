:summary: We have a new website.

We are excited to announce the launch of the new Miners Online website, now built with Pelican, a powerful Python-based static site generator, and styled with M.CSS.

Why the Change?
===============

At Miners Online, we continuously strive to enhance your experience and provide the best possible platform for our Minecraft community. Our previous website served us well, but it was time for an upgrade to meet modern web standards and performance expectations. By switching to Pelican and M.CSS, we have made significant improvements in speed, responsiveness, and overall user experience.

What's New?
===========

Here are some of the key features and improvements you can expect from our new website:

- **Faster Load Times**: As a static site, the new website loads much faster, providing a seamless browsing experience.
- **Modern Design**: M.CSS has allowed us to create a clean, responsive design that looks great on all devices.
- **Enhanced Content Management**: With Pelican, managing and updating our content has become more efficient, ensuring that you receive the latest server news, updates, and event announcements promptly.
- **Improved Navigation**: Our new layout and menu structure make it easier to find the information you need.

About Pelican
=============

Pelican is a static site generator that allows us to create content in reStructuredText or Markdown, which is then transformed into a static website. This approach eliminates the need for a traditional server-side setup, enhancing security and performance.

About M.CSS
===========

M.CSS is a modern, lightweight CSS framework that provides a clean, responsive design out of the box. It is designed to work seamlessly with Pelican, enabling us to build a beautiful, user-friendly website with minimal effort.

Explore the New Site
====================

We invite you to explore our new website and experience the improvements first-hand. Whether you're looking for the latest server news, detailed guides, or event announcements, Miners Online is now better equipped to serve you.

Stay Connected
==============

As always, we value your feedback. If you have any comments or suggestions about the new website, please don't hesitate to reach out to us through our GitHub.

Thank you for being a part of the Miners Online community. We look forward to continuing to provide you with the best content and resources for your Minecraft adventures.
